1. WRITING PART
What are the boolean values in your language? (e.g., True and False, true and false, 1, and 0, etc.)
		The boolean value in C++: true and false | 1 and 0
2. What types of conditional statements are available in your language? (if/else, if/then/else, if/elseif/else).  Does your language allow for statements other than “if” (for example, Perl has an “unless” statement, which does the opposite of “if”!)
The type of conditional statements are available in C++:
if/ else
if/ else if/ else 
Switch
3. How does your language delimit code blocks under each condition in selection control statements?
	In C++, the code block is delimited under each condition in the selection control statement by moving from one to another code depending on whether a particular condition is sastified or not.
	4. Does your language use short-circuit evaluation? Include an example of the short-circuit logic working or not working (or both, if your language is like Java and supports both!)
	Yes, C++ supports short-circuit evaluation 
	Ex:
	int u = -3, i = 10;
    if(u>0 && i >0){
        std::cout << "both two numbers are bigger than zero" << endl;
    }
	5. How does your programming language deal with the “dangling else” problem?
	It will prioritize counting the else for the inner if for example we have the below code:
int a = 5, b=7, c=7;
    if (a>5)
    if(b>6){
        std::cout << "alo";
    }else{
        std::cout << "olo";
    }
Because the else statement is counted for the inner if then the result to cout is nothing because the if condition (a>5) failed without any else statement.  
6. If your language supports switch or case statements, do you have to use “break” to get out of them? Can you use “continue” to have all of the conditions evaluated?
Yes, in c++ we need to use break to get out of switch or case statements. And we are also able to use “continue” to have all of the conditions evaluated

2. PROGRAMMING PART


#include <iostream>
using std::endl;
int main(){
    //a one-condition if/else statement (i.e. "if x == true")

    bool x = true;
    if(x==true){
        std::cout << "True" << endl;
    };
    //a multi-condition if/else statement (i.e. "if x>0 && y< 10)

    int a = 3, b = 10;
    if(a>0 && b <20){
        std::cout << a + b << endl;
    }
    //if/elif/else statements
    int z = 6;
    if(z>3){
        std::cout << "z is bigger than 3" << endl;
    }else if (z<3){
        std::cout << "z is smaller than 3" << endl;
    }else {
        std::cout << "z is equal 3" << endl;
    }
    //short-circuit logic
    int u = -3, i = 10;
    if(u>0 && i >0){
        std::cout << "both two numbers are bigger than zero" << endl;
    }
    if(u>0 || i >0){
        std::cout << "there is at least one number bigger than 0" << endl;
    }
    //a switch-case statement
    int s=10;
    switch(s){
    case 0:
        std::cout << "bad" << endl;
        break;
    case 5:
        std::cout << "moderate" << endl;
        break;
    case 10:
        std::cout << "excellent" << endl;
        break;
    default:
        std::cout << "Point" <<endl;
        break;
    }


    return 0;
}
