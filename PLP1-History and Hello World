This  is my repo for learning c++ in programming language course

1. What is the name of your language?
   My language name is C ++ 
2. When/where was it created, and by whom? Was it written to address a particular problem or need?
   It was created in 1985 by Bjarne Stroustrup. It was written as an extension of C programming language
3. What types of programming is your language primarily used for (ex: web sites, video games, mobile devices, parsing, etc.)? 
   If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of different projects it's been used for.
   C++ is a multi-purpose programming language, which is applied in desktop applications (Adobe systems such as Illustrator, Photoshop,..), 
   video games (CSGO, League of Legends, PUBG, Call of Duty), servers core of e-commerse, web search or databases (Firstfox, google applications, MySQL) 
   and performance-critical applications such as operating Systems (Apple OS, Microsoft Windows OS), banking applications (Infosys Finacle)
5. Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it? At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, 
   website URLs, or any other resources that relate to your language in particular.
   I will mainly learn C++ from w3school which is always most used platform of mine for other language. Besides that there is another free course named "C++ tutorial 
   for complete beginners" on Udemy, which is also my learning resource


To install the language, we need to have an IDE that have the language package we wwant to install. In my case, I choose Visual studio which has package C/C++. 
Then I need to install the compiler for C ++ named msys2 so that I we can run C++ on our device.
C++ has another recommended IDE that is Visual Studio, but due to some reasons I could not run HelloWorld on this IDE. 
Therefore I have chosen Visual studio which is more familiar to me to be my IDE. To run program in C++, we just need to write program and run it by the key combination 
Crtl + Alt + N. But before that, we need to write a complete program which contains the header (#include <iostream>) and main component (int main())
